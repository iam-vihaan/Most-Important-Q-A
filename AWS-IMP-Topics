1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
● A logically isolated network in AWS.
● Allows you to define IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and security groups.
● Used for securely hosting resources like EC2, RDS, and EKS.

2. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
● Virtual machines in the cloud.
● Allows scaling instances up/down as needed.
● Supports various instance types optimized for compute, memory, or storage.

3. RDS (Relational Database Service)
● Managed relational database service (supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server,
etc.).
● Handles automatic backups, scaling, and patching.
● Multi-AZ support for high availability.

4. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
● Manages user permissions and roles.
● Uses policies to control access to AWS services.
● Supports MFA for security.

5. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
● Managed Kubernetes service.
● Allows running Kubernetes clusters without managing control planes.
● Integrates with AWS services like ALB, IAM, and CloudWatch.

6. Route 53
● Scalable Domain Name System (DNS).
● Supports domain registration, health checks, and traffic routing.
● Can route traffic based on latency, geolocation, or weighted policies.

7. CloudWatch
● Monitoring and logging service.
● Collects metrics from AWS services and custom logs.
● Can trigger alerts and automate actions using alarms.

8. CloudTrail
● Tracks API activity across AWS accounts.
● Provides logs for security auditing and compliance.
● Can be integrated with CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.

9. Lambda
● Serverless compute service.
● Runs code in response to events (S3 uploads, API Gateway requests, etc.).
● Automatically scales without needing to manage infrastructure.

10. ECS (Elastic Container Service)
● Managed container orchestration for Docker containers.
● Supports Fargate (serverless) and EC2-backed clusters.
● Integrates with ALB, IAM, and CloudWatch.


Here are some expected interview questions on AWS VPC, IAM, Lambda, EC2,
CloudWatch, ECS, and EKS, along with key points for answering them:

#VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Basic Questions:

✅ What is VPC in AWS?
● A logically isolated network for AWS resources.
● Allows control over subnets, route tables, gateways, and security groups.
✅ What are the main components of a VPC?
● Subnets (public/private)
● Route tables
● Internet Gateway (IGW)
● NAT Gateway (for private subnets)
● Security Groups & NACLs
● VPC Peering & Transit Gateway
✅ What is the difference between Security Groups and NACLs?
● Security Groups → Stateful, applies at instance level, allows only "allow" rules.
● NACLs (Network ACLs) → Stateless, applies at subnet level, allows "allow" &
"deny" rules.

Advanced Questions:

✅ How do you connect two VPCs?
● VPC Peering (direct connection)
● Transit Gateway (central hub for multiple VPCs)
● VPN / Direct Connect (connect to on-prem)
✅ How do you make a private subnet access the internet?
● Use a NAT Gateway in a public subnet.
